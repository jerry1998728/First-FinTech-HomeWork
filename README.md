## The Most Innovative Company Originated From Standford University

* RobinHood Markets, Inc.

* RobinHood was incorporated in 2014 by two Standford University, Baiju Bhatt and Vlad Tenev.

* Baiju and Vlad built two finance companies in New York after graduation. While experiencing the beauty of Wall Street, Baiju and Vlad found the crucial problem to solve, the commission-fees in the stock market. In 2013, the two young men went back to Menlo Park, California, and built the online trading platform called Robinhood, which allows everyone to access the financial markets with no commission fees.

* As a survivor out of the numerous startups, rounds of funding were inevitable. According to *[Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/robinhood/company_financials " Robinhood Markets, Inc")*, Robinhood Markets, Inc. has received a total funding amount of $1.7B from 55 investors to this date. Out of the 55 investors, there are 7 major investors, such as D1 Capital Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, TSG Consumer Partners, and Sequoia Capital.


* The company has been fighting successfully in the past 15 funding rounds, from Series A to Series G. Although the company has the intention to go for the Initial Public Offerings (IPO), the company is currently held private.

## Business Activities

*  According to the company, "*We are on a mission to democratize finance for all.*" Robinhood solves the problem of commission fees when trading stocks and other financial products, and leads the wave of online brokers.

* According to one of the values stated on the company's [official website](https://careers.robinhood.com/), *"Our mission is to empower this new generation to take greater ownership in their financial future, which we believe can help shrink the gap between ... robust global economy."* As stated by the company, the targeted customers are the new generations.
Moreover, this coincides with the news. The New York Times author Nathaniel Popper published news with the title [*"Robinhood Has Lured Young Traders, Sometimes With Devastating Results"*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html) on July 8th, 2020. As the pioneer of a free trading platform, indeed, Robinhood has successfully drawn numerous young customers like my friends and myself with the zero-commission fee flag and addition of fancy mobile application.

* According to [*Stack*](https://stack.g2.com/company/robinhood), there are currently 39 technologies implemented on Robindhood's website, such as python 3, Airflow, React JS, and Django, etc. Moreover, Hongxia Zhong, an engineering manager at Robinhood published a [*post*](https://robinhood.engineering/under-the-hood-of-clearing-by-robinhood-3ed7ab09d60) on Medium which shares the technologies used by the company. According to manager Zhong, *"Python and Django allowed us to model complex financial objects and quickly stand up API servers. We would have had a much harder time shipping nearly a hundred brokerage workflows without adopting modern web development frameworks like React JS and Redux."*

### Landscape

* Robinhood, as an online broker, makes stocks, cryptocurrencies, and ETFs, etc, more accessible for the public. Therefore, the company is in the domain of retail investing and secondary markets.

* The major trends and innovations in the domain of retail investing and secondary markets undoubtedly are because of the technological progress, such as online platforms, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. According to the [*World Wealth Report*](https://worldwealthreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/11/Top-Ten-Trends-in-Capital-Market-2019.pdf), *"Today, AI and related technologies such as machine learning (ML), distributed ledger technology (DLT), and robotic process automation (RPA) is enabling new levels of business process efficiency and effectiveness ranging from trading and post-trade operations to cybercrime and applications of quantum computing."* Indeed, artificial-intelligence related technologies are powerful in efficiently processing different or repetitive tasks, such as processing customers' orders in the online stock markets. 

* Of course, Robinhood is not running a monopoly business. There are several other competitors in the domain, such as Groww, OpenInvest, YieldStreet, Etoro, Gorila, and Webull.

## Results

* The business impact of this innovative company is more than significant and is essentially rewriting and making the history in stock trading and financial markets. Comparing to the traditional financial markets, Robinhood is the innovation that upgrades the financial system and unlocks the exclusiveness for the public. According to a [*CNN Business news*](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/13/investing/robinhood-free-trading-fractional-shares/index.html "This app completely disrupted the trading industry.") published by Matt Egan, "Established players were forced to rewrite their business models by abolishing commissions. The extreme disruption even prompted the blockbuster merger of industry leaders Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD)." While changing the history, the company doesn't just ignore other broker's customers, and their action responds to their mission. I believe that "doing as promised" has also promised the company's success.

* Several core metrics are used to measure success based on the industry and the domain. As in the brokerage industry, the daily average revenue trade (DART) is traditionally used to measure the revenue (commission fees) generated by the daily average trades. However, for an online broker like Robinhood, there are similar but yet different metrics for measuring the success of the website and the mobile application. Metrics such as users, website views, application downloads, are all used to measure the success of most online platforms. As for the users of Robinhood, according to the [*Finance Magnates*](https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/robinhood-tops-13-million-users-raises-280m-at-8-3b-valuation/), Robinhood as of April 5, 2020, has 13 million registered users. 

* While Robinhood has 13 million users, the largest brokerage in the country, Charles Schwab, has just 14.3 million accounts, according to its [*official website*](https://www.aboutschwab.com/charles-schwab). Therefore, Robinhood has been amazingly successful in the past seven years. However, users can only partially represent the company's competitiveness, and capital would be another tool to measure a company's health. Based on a report from John Divine, a senior investing reporter of U.S News & World Report, Robinhood's valuation of $7.6 billion ranks the last place among other 3 major competitors in the domain, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and E-Trade with $50.4 billion, $19.5 billion, and $9.7 billion, respectively.

## Recommendations

* While Robinhood shines in its way, there is still room to improve in overall. If I were to advise the company, I would suggest offering better customer support. After researching, there's no evidence that the company has a customer support number that directs to live agents.

* I think that customer support is essential in business because customers are the ones that matter. I have also once heard Jeff Bezos sharing the success of Amazon, and he said that Amazon puts all the focuses on the customers, instead of the enemies or competitors. I couldn't agree more with Jeff since the evidence is right there.

* As we live in this fast-paced world, every industry has been somehow affected by the advancement of technology, and so does customer service. Currently, besides the traditional live support, self-service or automated support has been utilized by countless companies. 

* Moreover, there is voice recognition based on artificial-intelligence that could record and recognize the voice of customers, which is extremely helpful to efficiently, accurately, and safely identifying the customers. Voice recognition is more than appropriate for companies like Robinhood, that provide services that includes sensitive information about customers.
